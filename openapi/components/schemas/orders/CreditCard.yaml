      - `redirect`: Customers are redirected to a [MultiSafepay payment page](https://docs.multisafepay.com/payment-pages/) where they enter their cardholder data. 
      - `direct`: The API request contains the cardholder data, so customers are redirected to an authentication or success page.

      For more information, see [Direct vs redirect API requests](https://docs.multisafepay.com/developer/direct-vs-redirect).
      
      **Note**: To process `direct` credit card payments, you must have PCI DSS certification, see [Handling cardholder data](https://docs.multisafepay.com/features/handling-cardholder-data/).
