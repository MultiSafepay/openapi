      **Suppressing Second Chance emails after cancellation**


      When a customer places an order, goes to your checkout, doesnâ€™t complete payment, but later returns and tries to pay again, some webshops create a second order. 
      
      
      If Second Chance emails are enabled, the customer still receives emails for the first order, even after they complete payment for the second order.

      Cancelling the first order does **not** suppress Second Chance emails. To suppress emails, make an Update order details: CancelOrder request.
